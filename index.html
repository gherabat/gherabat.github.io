    <p>Seneca lived in Ancient Rome and was a stoic philosopher</p>
    <p>Stoic phiolosphy centered on the following tenets:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>There are things we can and cannot control</li>
      <li>It is pointless and exhausting to concern ourselves with things we cannot control</li>
      <li>We should only focus on things we can control</li>
     </ol>
